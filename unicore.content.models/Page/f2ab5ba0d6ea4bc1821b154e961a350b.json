  "content": "While initial cases of the Ebola Virus Disease are contracted by handling or eating infected animals or carcasses, most cases occur by direct contact with the bodily fluids of an infected person. Several steps can be taken to help prevent infections and limit or stop the transmission of the disease. \r\n\r\n - Understand the nature of the disease, how it is transmitted, and how to prevent it from spreading further. \r\n - Listen to and follow directives issued by the Ministry of Health.\r\n - If you suspect someone close to you or in your community of having Ebola Virus Disease, encourage and support them in seeking appropriate medical treatment in a health-care facility.\r\n - Wash your hands with clean water and soap after visiting hospitals or caring for any other patient. \r\n - Develop the habit of washing your hands with clean water and soap regularly, especially before eating or touching food.\r\n - Avoid touching your mouth, your nose, or your open sores with dirty hands.\r\n - Avoid touching materials or clothes that have been used by an infected person.\r\n - Additionally, individuals should reduce contact with high-risk infected animals such as fruit bats, monkeys or apes when there is an outbreak.\r\n",
